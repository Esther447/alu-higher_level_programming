# Python If/Else Loops Functions Project

This project consists of Python scripts that demonstrate the use of `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to handle conditional logic.

## Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing

### Description:
This Python script assigns a random signed number to a variable `number` and prints whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

### Requirements:
- The script uses the `random.randint()` function to generate a random number between -10 and 10.
- The script prints:
  - If the number is greater than 0: `"<number> is positive"`
  - If the number is 0: `"<number> is zero"`
  - If the number is less than 0: `"<number> is negative"`

### How to Run:
To run the script, ensure it is executable by running:
```bash
chmod +x 0-positive_or_negative.py
