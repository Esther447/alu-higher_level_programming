# Python - If/Else, Loops, and Functions

This project explores the use of conditional statements, loops, and functions in Python programming. The tasks focus on using `if` statements, loops like `for` and `while`, and other important Python constructs.

## Requirements
- All files are interpreted using Python 3.8.5.
- All scripts must be executable.
- The code adheres to `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.*).
- All files end with a new line.

## Project Structure

- **0-positive_or_negative.py**: This script assigns a random number to a variable and prints whether the number is positive, zero, or negative.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd python-if_else_loops_functions
    ```
3. Make the script executable (if not already done).
    ```bash
    chmod +x 0-positive_or_negative.py
    ```
4. Run the script.
    ```bash
    ./0-positive_or_negative.py
    ```

Each time you run the script, it will output whether the generated number is positive, zero, or negative.
